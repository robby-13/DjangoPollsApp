Web application built in a Python Virtual Environment using
the Django Framework. The program works in both a client and 
administrator interface. 

Clients are able to view questions and cast votes,
immediately after casting their vote they are able
to see the current results of the poll and see
which response is leading and which one(s) are not.

Admins have the ability to create/update/delete questions
answer choices as they please.
